    <h1>OpenTrailView :: About</h1>

	<h2>What is OpenTrailView?</h2>

	<p><em>OpenTrailView</em> is a project to collect Android
	<a href="http://www.google.co.uk/maps/about/contribute/Photo Sphere">
	Photo Spheres</a>
	and combine them with 
	<a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a>
	data to produce virtual tours of the countryside, in which users can
	navigate from one Photo Sphere to the next. The idea is basically to
	produce something similar to Google Street View, but for footpaths rather
	than roads, and (to avoid creating silly amounts of data) showing the
	Photo Spheres at key points only, such as junctions, views or other
	points of interest, rather than every few metres. </p>

	<h2>How to contribute</h2>

	<p>Contributing is easy if you have a recent Android device. Simply:
		<ul>
		<li><a href="user.php?action=signup">Sign up</a> for an account</li>
		<li>Make sure the Photo Sphere camera app is installed on your device.
		For some Google Nexus devices, it's probably there already. If you
		have another modern Android device such as the Galaxy SIII or S4,
		you'll need to install the Photo Sphere camera app separately, as 
		the default camera app does not take Photo Spheres.
		This has been made available by a third party, see
		<a href="http://forums.androidcentral.com/htc-one-google-edition/292206-google-edition-camera-app-w-Photo Sphere-easy-install-no-root-needed.html">
		here.</a>
		</li>
		<li>Take your Photo Sphere at your desired location. Ensure that your
		GPS is on, because at present Photo Spheres must be tagged with 
		latitude and longitude to be accepted by OpenTrailView.</li>
		<li>Upload your Photo Sphere from the main page, after logging in.
		Note that all
		Photo Spheres need to be authorised (to guard against questionable
		content being uploaded). Once authorised your Photo Sphere will
		be able to be viewed; it will be shown by a camera icon on the map.
		</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	
	<h2>Supported browsers</h2>

	<p>Current versions of Firefox and Chrome are supported. Sorry, for the
	moment Internet Explorer isn't supported - it will at some point in the
	future.</p>

	<h2>Current status and Future plans</h2>

	<p>Right now, OpenTrailView <em>shows uploaded Photo Spheres on the map
	</em>. You can view a Photo Sphere by clicking on the camera icon. 
	You can also show the nearest photo sphere to a given location
	by clicking the <em>"pano view"</em> link, though given there are only
	a small number of spheres loaded right now, this might be some 
	considerable distance away!</p>
	<p>
	The functionality to link Photo Spheres using the underlying OSM data
	is not yet implemented, but is intended to be soon. Note that on this
	server, <em>this linking together will only work for certain areas of
	the UK, and not globally, as, due to server limitations, only OSM data
	for certain parts of the UK is included; see
	<a href="http://www.free-map.org.uk/0.6/about.html#village">here</a></em>.
	Because of this, you might be interested in setting up an OpenTrailView
	server for your own country; see
	<a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OpenTrailView">here</a>.
