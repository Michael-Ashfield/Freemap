    <h1>OpenTrailView2 :: About</h1>

	<h2>What is OpenTrailView?</h2>

	<p><em>OpenTrailView</em> is a project to collect Android
	<a href="http://www.google.co.uk/maps/about/contribute/photosphere">
	Photo Spheres</a>
	and link them (using 
	<a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a>
	mapping as a guide)
	to produce virtual tours of the countryside, in which users can
	navigate from one Photo Sphere to the next. The idea is basically to
	produce something similar to Google Street View, but for footpaths rather
	than roads, and (to avoid creating silly amounts of data which servers
	cannot handle) showing the
	Photo Spheres at key points only, such as junctions, attractive
	views or other points of interest, rather than every few metres. </p>

	<p>The original OpenTrailView appeared in 2010 and was presented at
	SOTM Girona that year; however it required a long and cumbersome process
	to contribute panoramas. Users had to use regular cameras, take panoramic
	shots and stitch them together using third-party stitching software, as
	well as taking a GPS trace to place the panoramas by comparing timestamps.
	With Photo Spheres doing most of that work for you, the contribution 
	process should hopefully be a lot more straightforward!</p>

	<h2>How to contribute</h2>

	<p>Contributing is easy if you have a reasonably recent (probably 4.x)
	Android device. 
	Simply:
		<ul>
		<li><a href="user.php?action=signup">Sign up</a> for an account</li>
		<li>Make sure the Photo Sphere camera app is installed on your device.
		For recent Google Nexus devices, it should be there already. If you
		have another modern Android device such as the Galaxy SIII or S4,
		you'll need to install the Photo Sphere camera app separately, as 
		the default camera app does not take Photo Spheres.
		This has been made available by a third party, see
<a href=
"http://www.androidcentral.com/get-photosphere-non-nexus-devices-google-edition-camera-app"> here.</a>
		</li>
		<li>Take your Photo Sphere at your desired location. Ensure that your
		GPS is on, because at present Photo Spheres must be tagged with 
		latitude and longitude to be accepted by OpenTrailView.</li>
		<li>Upload your Photo Sphere from the main page, after logging in.
		Note that all
		Photo Spheres need to be authorised (to guard against questionable
		content being uploaded). Once authorised your Photo Sphere will
		be able to be viewed; it will be shown by a camera icon on the map.
		</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	
	<h2>Supported Browsers and Issues</h2>
	<p>This software is in an early stage and therefore there are
	currently a few issues:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Current versions of Firefox and Chrome are supported, as well as 
	Internet Explorer 10. Sorry, for the
	moment older versions of Internet Explorer are not supported.</li>
	<li>Loading Photo Spheres is currently rather slow. Hopefully a solution
	can be found to this by tweaking the underlying Photo Sphere library.</li>
	<li>There are sometimes some odd glitches where map tiles don't load
	properly for a while once you have viewed a Photo Sphere. This seems
	to happen on both Linux and Windows and all of Firefox, Chrome and IE.
	I'm guessing it might be a memory issue and again something that
	could probably be fixed by tweaking the underlying library.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Current status and Future plans</h2>

	<p>Right now, OpenTrailView <em>shows uploaded Photo Spheres on the map
	</em>. You can view a Photo Sphere by clicking on the camera icon. 
	You can also show the nearest photo sphere to a given location
	by clicking the <em>"pano view"</em> link, though given there are only
	a small number of spheres loaded right now, this might be some 
	considerable distance away!</p>
	<p>
	The functionality to link Photo Spheres 
	is not yet implemented, but is intended to be soon. 
	This will involve users linking spheres on the map interface by 
	connecting them with lines.
	</p>
	
	<h2>IMPORTANT - linking with OSM is key!</h2>

	<p>The idea of
	<em>linking the Photo Spheres</em>
	to provide virtual tours of off-road areas is the whole point of the site. 
	<em>Please only upload a
	Photo Sphere if</em> it was taken on a recognised off-road route of some 
	kind, such as:
		<ul>
		<li>a countryside trail or track;</li>
		<li>a recognised climbing or trekking route (e.g. up a mountain,
		or through wild country);</li>
		<li>or an urban path such as in a city park.</li>
		</ul>
	If you are interested in a general Photo Sphere sharing site, please
	visit <a href="http://www.sphereshare.net">SphereShare.net</a>.</p>
	<p>However, there does <em>not</em> have to be an existing OSM way there
	already. It just has to be a route that would make sense as an OSM way.
	So if it's unmapped, why not <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org">
	survey it for OSM</a> too!</p>
