<h1>Other stuff...</h1>
<p>The Freemap server hosts both 
<a href='http://www.free-map.org.uk'>Freemap</a> and
<a href='http://www.opentrailview.org'>OpenTrailView</a>. However there's
also a range of extra software both hosted on, and available for download
from, this site. 
Much of it is for historical interest only, but some
of it may be useful to you and it's all open source so needs to be offered
for download somewhere :-)</p>
