<h1>OpenTrail - Freemap for Android</h1>
<hr />
<p>Freemap has a full featured Android app - <em>OpenTrail</em>.
It provides many of the features of a
typical OSM mobile app, but with a few unique features, in particular the
ability to report path problems and add points of interest and path directions
in the field, as well as present these live to you in the field while you are
out walking.</p>

<h2> What can you do with OpenTrail?</h2>
<ul style="margin-left: 10px">
<li>View OpenStreetMap-derived 
maps of the majority of England (Wales and Scotland not covered
just yet) showing public rights of way in the
<a href='/fm/about.html#mapkey'>same colour scheme as Freemap itself</a>
together with Ordnance Survey LandForm PANORAMA contours. The maps are
rendered using the <a href='https://github.com/mapsforge/mapsforge'>
Mapsforge</a> library and 
initially downloaded to your device, and then stored on the device or 
SD card.</li>
<li>Add annotations to the map in-the-field, which can be shared
with other users. These can be anything you like
(within reason!) and are added to Freemap's annotations database. So you can
share points of interest, interesting views, path directions in awkward
places, and path blockages with other users. Then, when someone else uses
OpenTrail later on, details of that annotation will be presented to them in
the field. It's my aim with Freemap and OpenTrail to produced a crowd-sourced
source of information for walkers throughout the country. Note that you
have to provide your Freemap login details int he app preferences, otherwise
the annotations will have to be authorised before going live.</li>
<li>View annotations and directions in-the-field contributed by other
users. So, if you find yourself in the middle of a large field with no
apparent way out, OpenTrail will tell you where to aim for!</li>
<li>Download and <em>"play"</em>
walking routes from Freemap. As you may know, you can create
walking routes on the main Freemap site; these can be downloaded into
OpenTrail (as GPX files with waypoints for each stage of the route)
and <em>"played" on your device</em>. So, when you get to the start of the
next stage of the walk, the instructions will be presented to you live
in-the-field.</li>
<li>Record new walking routes and save them as GPX files. These can be 
uploaded to Freemap and shared with other users.  Theoretically this
functionality can of course be used to survey new data for OSM, but I have
not yet tested its robustness over several hours or its effect on the
battery, so it is not recommended just yet.</li>
<li>Find nearby points of interest (but that's pretty standard for an
OSM mobile app). The POIs are obtained from the Freemap server and
consequently this functionality is only available in areas with Freemap
coverage.</li>
<li>Save annotations on the device for later upload, reducing the need
for network access in-the-field. Also, annotations and POIs are cached
on the device, meaning that after initial network access, the app can
be used completely offline if desired.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Download</h2>
	<ul>
	<li><a href="../downloads/android/opentrail.apk">OpenTrail 0.1</a>,
	works on Android 2.1+. Better tested but using an older version (0.3
	rather than 0.5) of Mapsforge.</li>
	<li>OpenTrail 0.2 is the version
	<a href="https://github.com/nickw1/Freemap/tree/master/java/opentrail">
    available in github</a> but note this is buggy and is going to be replaced
	by a new 0.3 version soon which downloads the map data live and caches it
	on the device. Please use 0.1 for the moment; it is fully functional.</li>
	</ul>
<p>Please <a href="../downloads/android/README_BEFORE_DOWNLOADING.txt">
read this</a> before downloading!</p>
<h2>Brief instructions</h2>
<p><em>It is recommended you run OpenTrail for the first time in a wi-fi 
area as map data needs to be downloaded.</em> Fire up the app. You will be
prompted to download a style file from the Freemap server; this controls the
look-and-feel of the maps. Then, when you get a GPS signal, you will be 
prompted to download a map file for your local area (map files cover the 
standard OS 100x100km grid squares). This is a binary file containing the map
data. Once downloaded you will be able to use the app in that 100x100km area
without needing a network connection for the map.</p>
<p>As an alternative to the 100x100km squares of map data you can now
(Dec 13) download the whole of England or Wales, though note 
<em>these are large files (150 to 300MB!)</em> so you'll probably want wifi.</p>
<p>Hopefully most of the menu options will be self-explanatory. One thing to
note is that you can <em>automatically download new point of interest and
annotation data as you travel</em> avoiding the need to manually download
data. Point of interest and annotation data is then cached on the device to
avoid network access next time, though there is an option to force download
of new data rather than use the cache (for example, if someone else adds a
new annotation in the meantime).</p>
<h2>IMPORTANT! This is BETA SOFTWARE!</h2>
<p>OpenTrail is <em>beta software</em>. While I have endeavoured to keep bugs 
to a minimum
I cannot guarantee that it is bug-free. It is possible that the app
will crash. To help fix bugs, please note that <em>if the app does crash,
it will send a bug report to a spreadsheet on my (nickw)'s Google Drive</em>
via
the <a href="http://www.acra.ch">ACRA</a> bug reporting system. Please ONLY
install if you are happy with this!</p>
<h2>Missing features?</h2>
<p>
If there are any things you would like to see added, or have ideas
for features that could make it to the next release, please
<a href="mailto:nickw4426@gmail.com">email me</a> (Nick Whitelegg, nickw on
OSM)</p>
<h2>Looking for augmented reality?</h3>
<p>If you were at SOTM or SOTM-EU in 2011, you may remember that I presented
an early version of OpenTrail featuring augmented reality, overlaying OSM
data on the device's camera feed. OpenTrail no longer includes this
functionality, however the AR is still very much in development!
Because it is experimental, it has been moved to its own app, Hikar.
See <a href='hikar.html'>here</a>.</p>
<h2>Source code</h2>
<p>OpenTrail is an open-source application (GPL; libraries are LGPL): see
the <a href="https://github.com/nickw1/Freemap">Freemap github page</a>,
OpenTrail source is in the "java" directory.</p>
