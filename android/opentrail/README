OpenTrail
=========

The beginnings of an Android app aimed at walkers and other outdoor users
of the countryside.

The apk is available at http://www.free-map.org.uk/downloads/android.

To build from source you need:

- the osmdroid JAR, at least version 3.0.5: 
see http://code.google.com/p/osmdroid/

- the SLF4J JAR (v1.5.8 definitely works, haven't tried others):
see http://www.slf4j.org/android/

- jcoord, see http://www.jstott.me.uk/jcoord/

- Modified Java proj.4, 
from http://www.free-map.org.uk/downloads/javalib/javaproj-1.0.6-noawt.jar

- Freemaplib, 
from http://www.free-map.org.uk/downloads/javalib/freemaplib.jar

Licence of opentrail: GPL v2, or any later version.

The "person.png" image is from osmdroid.
The annotation "asterisk" icon is based on a similar one from the icons used in
OSM Mapnik maps, but with the colour changed to red.
