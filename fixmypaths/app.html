<h1>The FixMyPaths App - Testers Wanted!</h1>
<p>
The <em>FixMyPaths Android app</em> allows you to report the problems on 
Hampshire rights of way <em>while out on a walk</em>. 
Say you come across a missing signpost,
or a blocked path, you can fire up the app and report the problem
directly to Hampshire County Council (it is the intention to expand out of
Hampshire in the future). The app
will contact the FixMyPaths server to find out if there is a nearby right of
way, and if there is, you will be given the chance to enter the problem report.
The report will be stored in FixMyPaths' own database <em>and</em> emailed
to Hampshire County Council. The app is in an early stage of development and
has been tested by myself live in-the-field, but I am looking for
<em>additional testers</em>. So if you live in or near Hampshire, like walking,
and have an Android 2.1+ phone, please 
<a href='http://www.free-map.org.uk/downloads/android/fixmypaths.apk'>
download the app</a> and get testing!</p>
<h2>Instructions to use the app</h2>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Installing the FixMyPaths app to your phone
is at your <em>own risk</em>. It is software at an early stage of development;
it appears to be stable in tests but please do not blame me if it blows
up your phone. With that warning over, here are the instructions on how to
install and use the app.</p>
<ol>
<li>First of all configure your phone to allow installation of non-Market
(Google Play) apps. This will be under Settings: on a Samsung Galaxy SIII,
it is under "Security and Lock Screen". On the HTC Hero, it's under
"Applications". So try a settings category that looks like either of those
two.</li>
<li>If you have access to wifi, it's easy. Simply run the app within a
wifi area and when prompted, download the map data file. When in use,
FixMyPaths stores its maps locally on the phone rather than downloading them 
from a web server, but obviously you have to download the map onto the
phone initally! Do the same with the style file (file which defines the
look and feel of the map).</li>
<li>If you do not have access to wifi, it's a little trickier as the map file
is rather large (around 9 megabytes) so you need to download the map file
from a desktop or laptop and copy it to the phone's SD card.
Connect your phone up to
your desktop or laptop and find the SD card folder (on the Samsung Galaxy SIII
you should select the Phone folder instead, as on this model the map is
stored on the actual phone). Inside this folder, make a
folder called "openhants". Download the map file from
<a href='http://www.free-map.org.uk/data/android/hampshire_combined.map'>
here</a> and place it in the "openhants" folder.
If you are having difficulty with this step please email me on
freemapinfo at gmail dot com.</li>
<li>You should now be ready to go. Ensure that GPS is switched on, fill in
your name and email in the preferences (menu-preferences), find somewhere
suitable and report your problem! (for the testing period, this may be a
"fake" problem). There will soon be a "Download existing problems"
option which ensures that you do not try to report an existing problem
by showing them on the map.</li>
<li>Please report your experiences to me, Nick Whitelegg
at freemapinfo at gmail dot com.</li>
</ol>
<h2>System requirements</h2>
<p>Android 2.1+ needed. I have tested it on two devices: on the one hand an
HTC Hero and on the other a Samsung Galaxy SIII. On the Hero the map drawing
is rather slow and prone to occasional crashes while on the SIII it runs
smoothly. I'd be interested to know what performance is like on different
"in-between" models, again please email me (freemapinfo at gmail dot com).</p>
